One day, in the wilds of the Prairie of Prack, 
Coming different directions along the same track, 
Came a North-going-Zak and a South-going Zak. 
And, suddenly, both of them came to a place 
Where they bumped! And they stood.
Foot to foot. Face to face.
And the North-going-Zak snorted, “Look here! I say! 
You are blocking my path. You are right in my way. 
I’m a North-going-Zak, and I always go north.
Get out of my way, now, and let me go forth!”
Then the other replied, with a very sour mouth,
“I’m a South-going-Zak, and I always go south.
So I’m NOT in your way. You are standing in MINE. 
And, so, I command you to step out of line...
Just a foot to the east or a foot to the west...
And then I’ll continue my journey, you pest!”
Then the North-going-Zak huffed his chest up with pride,
 And he shouted, “I can’t and I won’t step aside!
Not an inch to the west! Not an inch to the east!
A North-going-Zak does not budge in the least!”
“My!” sneered the South-going-Zak. “My! My! My! 
You certainly are a most obstinate guy.
And if that’s how you feel, you will never pass by
If I have to stand here on this spot till I die.”
“VERY WELL!” yelled the North-going-Zak. “SO SHALL I!” 
And that is, exactly, what both of them said.
And they DID both stand there, till they both were quite dead.
